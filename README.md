# Adam Mullen, MBA, CSSC-CSSBB
Hello, world!

I'm Adam, and for the last 12+ years I've focused my efforts on building the knowledge, skills, competencies, and habits necessary to help others be as successful and effective as they can be.

This is a fledgling collection reflecting some of the work I've contributed to (and am permitted to share) over the years.

## Notes for included files

### Portfolio (updated Sept 2025)
This is a collection of samples and information on the themes of my career, program design work, and notable achievements, including:
- Time in major professional roles
- Explanation of my program design approach
- Sample high-level gamification design schema that frames how I approached it within the program
- High-level program outcomes map, using a Knowledge-Centered Service (KCS) implementation example
- High-level program schema for a competency-based Leadership Development training program that reflects the approach I used
- High-level session planning table reflecting the approach I used within the broader Leadership Development training program
- Sample measurement framework used for evaluating learning levels within the broader Leadership Development training program
- Sample snippets of VBA and Python code I wrote as an Analytics Manager and Data Analyst (see other code files for more robust and recent examples)
- Information and outcomes from my small business experience

### Data work functions
These are a collection of small, useful functions and shortcuts I wrote to help with the various analyses and deliverables I would complete in the People Analytics space

### Thinking in Systems presentation
This is a copy of a recent presentation I gave (under one of my small business entities) about Systems Theory and its application to change management. I presented to a group of executives, operational leaders, and thought leaders in the service operations space.
It was built using the insights, guidance, and information from _Thinking in Systems_ by Donella Meadows

### Daily script use case
This is a sample script I wrote to solve a simple use case: monitoring prior month-end employee termination totals to identify if/when a retroactive termination had been processed in our system of record.
Long story short: it was a low-lift workaround I built to give our team more advance notice of such retroactive terminations. Retroactive terminations caused significant rework for our monthly deliverables, so getting a heads up on them helped save time and effort.
