# Adam Mullen, MBA, CSSC-CSSBB
Hello world!

I'm Adam, and for the last 12+ years I've focused my efforts on building the knowledge, skills, competencies, and habits necessary to help others be as successful and effective as they can be.

This is a fledgling collection reflecting some of the work I've contributed to (and am permitted to share) over the last 12+ years.
